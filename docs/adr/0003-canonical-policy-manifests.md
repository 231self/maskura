# ADR 0003: Canonical CBOR and Ed25519 Policy Manifests

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-08-09

## Context

**Trust-boundary clarification (2026-09-23):**
[ADR 0022](0022-policy-approval-and-execution-trust-boundary.md) narrows the
operator-resistance language below to approval of signed artifacts, not proof
of their execution. The gateway/operator remains trusted. This original design
record is not evidence that the hosted envelope, publish-approval, or recovery
flows have shipped; existing signed pipeline configuration is covered by
[ADR 0021](0021-signed-toml-pipeline-configuration.md).

Tenant-defined pipeline configuration (destinations, routes, filters, limits) must be verifiably authentic. Maskura operators must not silently change policy. The signed manifest is the customer's attestable statement of intent.

Options considered:
- **JSON with detached signature**: Non-deterministic whitespace and key ordering make verification fragile.
- **Protobuf/FlatBuffers**: Binary formats with deterministic encoding, but separate schema tooling adds complexity.
- **Canonical CBOR with Ed25519**: Deterministic map ordering, compact binary encoding, and well-supported Rust libraries.

## Decision

Use canonical CBOR encoding with lexicographically sorted map keys and Ed25519 signatures. The manifest body is encoded deterministically, then signed. The resulting `SignedManifest` carries the canonical body bytes, signer ID, and signature. Verification validates the signature against trust roots and checks expiry/version monotonicity.

## Consequences

- Trust roots are tenant-managed Ed25519 public keys provisioned during onboarding.
- Policy updates require a new signature; the dashboard can draft but `maskura` signs and activates.
- Manifests have short expiry; monotonic version warnings on stale manifests discourage rollback.
- Implementation uses `ciborium` crate with BTreeMap-based canonical serialization.
